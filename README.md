# sine-visual

This is a simple python pygame application to visualize sum of sines.
It is very basic with polish and works by typing commands from the command prompt.

This is heavily inspired from the graphic simulation trick " Sum of Sines" to mimic the water in games.

# Thats it for now!! 

Ill be coming back to it in the future :)
